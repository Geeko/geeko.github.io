  It can be hard to find a place to start coding so in this article I will be going over how to do just that. I could go on and 
on about any of these sites but I will try to keep it short.You can use any of these sites on any computer for free so try all 
of them to see what works best for you. I would also like to note that Geeko Coding Studios is not sponsored by any of the 
sites mentioned in this article.Whithout furthur ado lets get into the list.

* [![Scratch Logo](https://scratch.mit.edu/images/logo_sm.png)](https://scratch.mit.edu)<br>
  Scratch is ever popular among beginners and young children. Just because scratch is made for children does not mean people
  of all ages use it as a platform to make amazing projects. In scratch you drag code blocks to manipulate sprites to create 
  animations and games. After you finish you project you can post it for other Scratchers to see. You can also look at other's
  projects. To get started with Scratch just click on the Scratch logo. After you open the link open the menu in the top 
  right corner and click "sign up" to create a Scratch account. From there everything is either explained in the tutorial or 
  super intuitive. If you don't understand where to get started coding there is a huge list of tutorials online and on Scratch.
  
* [![Khan Academy Logo](https://geeko.github.io/imgs/khanAcademyLogo.png)](https://khanacademy.org)<br>
  Khan academy is a great place to learn anything. Subjects include math, language, and even, drumroll please, programming! 
  Khan Academy has great courses from beginner to expert. Khan Academy focusses on lessons not projects which 
  is great if you would prefer more of a helping hand. One unique thing that Khan academy does is it has interactive videos 
  where you can pause the tutorial at any time to play with the code.Khan Academy has courses in several widely used languages 
  such as Javascript, SQL, HTML, and CSS. To get started on Khan Academy click on the Khan Academy logo, click "sign up" 
  to create a new account. After you create a new account click on "courses" then choose which course to take.
  
* [![Codecademy Logo](https://geeko.github.io/imgs/codecademyLogo.png)](https://codecademy.com)<br>
  Codecademy is a site designed specifiacally to teach coding. Codecademy has great free courses however you may want to    
  consider upgrading to pro if you really want the most out of Codecademy. Codecademy offers courses in many widely used 
  languages. They have a great guide for how to get started on their site which I strongly suggest you check out. Codecademy 
  gives you a chance to learn by doing by giving you instructions whith explanations next to a code editor so you write all the 
  code. If you have any questions there is a comment section on each activity so if your question hasn't already been answered 
  you can ask hundreds of people who are ready to help. To get started click on the Codecademy logo and create a new 
  account by entering in your desired account information into the form on the homepage. From there you can get a recomendation 
  or browse on your own.
  
* [![Youtube Logo](https://geeko.github.io/imgs/youtubeLogo.png)](https://youtube.com)<br>
  Youtube isn't just for watching funny cat videos it also has a vast collection of programming tutorials. In case you don't 
  know what Youtube is, and you've been living under a rock for the past decade or so, Youtube is a video sharing site where 
  you can watch all kinds of content and subscribe to creators you like and some big channels can even get money based on how 
  many veiws they get. While you can't code on Youtube there are still hundreds of talented proffesionals who post great 
  tutorials on all kinds of subjects. The great thing about Youtube is there are tutorials on lots of very specific problems 
  and subjects so it's easy to get started on what you want to do fast. to get started with youtube you don't need an account 
  to watch videos so you can just click on the logo and type what you want to see into the search bar.
  
  I hope that this list helps some people to get started. If you don't find what you want here a quick google search should 
turn up some good results. This blog is also a good place to start by reading my tutorials.
