I finally got around to creating a website for this little "Company" I call Geeko. I will be using this platform to create a portfolio of my work and as a way to allow people to, hopefully, become a supporters of Geeko. If you are wondering what you
get out of this site you can play games and use my projects, read blogs about coding, read tutorials, and connect to other programmers(coming soon!). I will be posting updates about this websites developements near daily.
