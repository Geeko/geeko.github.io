  I have recently been having trouble with the website such as crashes. Github was throwing odd errors that I couldn't 
decipher. I recently realized that liquid exception errors were being thrown due to a miss reading of an unclosed liquid tag. Anyhow it was a rookie mistake that I have learned from. The important piece is that the project page was shutdown and will be opened temporarily.
