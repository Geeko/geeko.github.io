  I finally added a way to comment on blog pages! I ended up adding disqus which is an open source commenting system used across.
multiple websites allowing you to follow websites and get email updates on your comments. It has a good filter and a well put 
together system. If you want to add disqus to your website scroll to the bottom of the page and click add disqus to your page or 
click this link <a href="https://disqus.com/features/engage/">here</a>.
