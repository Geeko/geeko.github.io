<h2>An overveiw</h2>
<p>		Geeko Coding Studios is a "company", quotes because the name is not trade marked etc., therefore, Geeko Coding Studios
 is not an official company, that creates applications of all kinds, games, utilities, and fun little side projects. I "own", 
 again Geeko Coding Studios is not officialy a company <i>yet</i>, Geeko Coding Studios and post projects, blogs etc. to this website.</p>

<h2>The mission</h2>
<p>	The mission here at Geeko Coding Studios is to create accessible open source coding projects and tutorials to spread the joy
